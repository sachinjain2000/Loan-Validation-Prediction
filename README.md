# Loan-Validation-Prediction
Credit risk management is essential to financial institutions as it directly affects business results. In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations, etc. The recipient (i.e. the borrower) incurs a debt, and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid, and also to repay the principal amount borrowed. The whole process of ascertaining if a borrower would pay back loans might be tedious hence the need to automate the procedure. Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence and relevant technologies are mostly elaborated topic in recent periods. Although artificial intelligence and machine learning are not new, micro-credit organizations are shy in accepting these methods in their credit risk assessment process and still use standard credit scoring methods based on linear calculation of a small number of indicators. This scoring model gives mixed and unreliable results. Machine learning, on the other hand, offers a much broader view of a client and can be used to manage not only credit risk, but other business risks too. The aim is to demonstrate, prediction using machine learning models generating very high accuracy however it depends on the quality of the data. Several algorithms were used to identify the best suited for the lending business.
